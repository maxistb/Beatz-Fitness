## Project Structure

The app is crafted in SwiftUI, fostering loose coupling via Swift Package Manager (SPM) to elegantly separate distinct screens into individual packages. On a foundational level, Nuke is employed for efficient rendering and display of images. CoreData is seamlessly integrated to securely store user data on the device. Native Charts contribute to an immersive experience by vividly presenting workout data.

In our pursuit of optimal development practices, SwiftLint and SwiftGen have been incorporated, elevating code quality and fostering a streamlined development process.
